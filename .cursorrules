Always work on feature branches first

Rules:
1. Default working branch is dev-new-features. Do not commit directly to main.
2. Create or switch to dev-new-features before making edits.
3. Open PRs from dev-new-features to main for merges.
4. Keep commits small and descriptive.
5. If a hotfix on main is necessary, cherry-pick into dev-new-features afterward.

Rationale:
- Ensures safe development flow and easier review.
- Prevents accidental changes being committed to main.
